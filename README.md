## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

FeedTo is a project made up by a few people just for fun. It can be used by anyone who wants to. There are no restrictions on what you can or cannot do with the project. It's all up to you.

## üöÄ Installation & Deploy <a name = "installation"></a>

We need to install few things. YOU NEED NODE.JS

Install all packages.

```
npm install
```

Now we can test if everything works.

```
npm run serve
```

If everything works we can deploy project.

```
npm run build
```

( In future there will be some screenshots etc...)
